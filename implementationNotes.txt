1) need to store x number of strings depending on input file
2) need a way to compare the strings + their lengths
3) also need a way to compare the lcs of the strings
        - Can use modified LCS method from the CommonSub class to return length of the LCS
            then make a method that will compare the strings' lengths and lcs lengths
4) need a way to display these results within a 2d array of characters like:
    
    01 02 03 04 05 06 07

01  -  H  M  D  M  L  D

02  -  -  H  H  D  D  H

03  -  -  -  L  M  D  M

04  -  -  -  -  M  L  M

05  -  -  -  -  -  M  L

06  -  -  -  -  -  -  M

07  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
